# Selmkies And Munros

**The Game of ‘Selkies and Munros’**

You are being asked to design, document, and implement a Scottish-themed version of the
popular board game ‘Snakes and Ladders’. The new version of the game will be called ‘Selkies and
Munros’. The remainder of this document will describe your project and the game that you are
being asked to implement.

**Aims of the Project**

The aims of the project are:
- To introduce you to team working during a design phase of the project (in Weeks 1 and 2).
- To enable you to demonstrate your understanding of the software development process,
from requirements gathering through design, coding, and testing.
- To give you assessed practice in software development through the design and
development of a larger, fully functional (and working!) application.

**It’s Time to Play!**

As mentioned above, you are being asked to design and implement a Scottish-themed version of
the popular board game ‘Snakes and Ladders’ which will be called ‘Selkies and Munros’. In Scottish
folklore, a Selkie is a mythical, seal-like creature that lives on both the land and the sea. A Munro
is a Scottish mountain which is over 3,000 metres in height.
In the traditional version of the game of Snakes and Ladders, players navigate a 2-D grid / game
board, making their way from a starting position at the bottom of the board to a finishing location
at the top. Players take turns moving their pieces / tokens across the board. On their turn, the
player rolls a die to determine how many spaces they can move. The winner of the game will be
the first player who reaches the finishing location on the board. Overlaying the board are some
obstacles or aids that the player may encounter in the form of snakes and ladders.
